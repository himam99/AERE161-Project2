# AERE161-Project2
Project 2: Flight Path of a Projectile for AerE 161 at Iowa State University for the Spring 2018 semester.

This repository contains:
  - the .pdf copy of the original assignment,
  - 5 .m files that generated graphs and values for the trajectory of an object,
  - a .tex document with a writeup on the process of working on this project, and
  - screenshots of code and output as .png files, used in creating the LaTeX document.

This project was made with Matlab, Notepad++, ShareLaTeX, blood, sweat, tears, and lots of love. Please enjoy.
